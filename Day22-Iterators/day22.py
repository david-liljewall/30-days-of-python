##* Iterables definition:
    # any value we can iterate over with something like a for loop. We can also destructure iterables, and we can create collections from them by passing the value to functions like "list" or "tuple"
    # Here are some examples:
        # strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, setes, range objects, zip objects, enumerate objects, map objects, filter objects
