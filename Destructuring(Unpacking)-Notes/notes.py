##* Destructuring in standard variable assignments

# Assign two variables :
x, y = ( 1, 2 )

print(f"x = {x}, y = {y}")

## What's going on under the hood:
# Python is creating a tuple with two elements, 1 & 2, and then deconstructing (unpacking) the tuple to its constituent parts and assigning each one to the variables on the left of the = sign
