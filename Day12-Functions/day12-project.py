#                                   PROJECT!                                   #

## For this project the application needs to have the following functionality:
# 1) Users should be able to add a book to their reading list by providing a book title, an author's name, and a year of publication.
# 2) The program should store information about all of these books in a Python list.
# 3) Users should be able to display all the books in their reading list, and these books should be printed out in a user-friendly format.
# 4) Users should be able to select these options from a text menu, and they should be able to perform multiple operations without restarting the program. You can see an example of a working menu in the post on while loops (day 8).
